# Telegram Bot for Trash Classification and Reward System

## Overview
This bot promotes environmental awareness by allowing users to classify trash, submit photos and videos, and earn points for responsible waste disposal. Administrators review submissions, and a leaderboard tracks top contributors.

## Features
- **Trash Classification**: Classifies trash using a TensorFlow Lite model. Model can analysie class_names as cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash.
- **Geolocation Tracking**: Users can send their location with waste images.
- **Submission Approval**: Admins approve or reject user submissions via inline buttons.
- **Point System**: Users earn points for approved submissions, with a leaderboard to track top contributors.
- **Database Integration**: Tracks user points and submissions using SQLite.

## Requirements
- Python check the runtime.txt
- Telegram Bot API Token
- TensorFlow Lite Runtime
- PIL (Pillow)
- SQLite3
- Nest Asyncio
- Python-Telegram-Bot

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eraly-ml/eco_AI.git
   cd repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash

## Technologies Used
- **Telegram Bot API**: For user interaction.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: For lightweight trash classification.
- **SQLite**: To store user data and track points.
- **Pillow**: For image preprocessing.

## How It Works

1. Users interact with the bot via commands and share location, photos, and videos.
2. The bot classifies the photo of trash by using a pre-trained MobileNet TensorFlow Lite model.
3. Submissions are reviewed by an admin and sendet to private chat of admins.
4. Approved submissions earn points and update the leaderboard.
